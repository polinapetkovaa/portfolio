## About me
I am a graduate student with a master of science degree in Marketing Analytics from Tilburg University (Netherlands). I've studied International Business Administration and during that time, I found my passion for statistics. Therefore, I decided to follow my affection and further developed my skills in statistical methods, data collection, analysis, presentation, and interpretation. Along my studies, I started an internship at Unilever, particularly in the Net Revenue Management department, where I am currently working on analytics projects aiming to increase the revenue of the company.

### AirBnB Project
#### *The effect of AirBnB host response time on bookings*

**Repository:** [`AirBnB Project Repository`](https://github.com/akalpaxi/InvestigatingAirbnbhosts)  
**Description:** Using data provided by [Inside AirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), we ran a *linear regression analysis* to investigate whether there is a relationship between the host response time and the number of bookings that the host has received. The datasets that were used for the analysis were cleaned, aggregated, and merged. Moreover, we automated the whole process from downloading the data to running the linear regression analysis and visualization by creating a make file.  
**Results:** The analysis shows that there is a statistically significant impact of replying quickly on the percentage of bookings for the listing.  
**Skills:** Data cleaning and preparation, merging datasets, data transformation, descriptive statistics, analysis (linear regression), hypothesis testing, visualization.  
**Language:** R language, makefile.
