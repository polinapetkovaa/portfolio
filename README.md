## About me
I am a graduate student with a master of science degree in Marketing Analytics from Tilburg University (Netherlands). I've studied International Business Administration and during that time, I found my passion for statistics. Therefore, I decided to follow my affection and further developed my skills in statistical methods, data collection, analysis, presentation, and interpretation. Along my studies, I started an internship at Unilever, particularly in the Net Revenue Management department, where I am currently working on analytics projects aiming to increase the revenue of the company.
